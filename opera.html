            ALL                 Unworthy thought! Unworthy thought!
                 We may succeed— who can foretell?
                 May heav'n help our hope—
                 May heav'n help our hope,
                           farewell!
                 May heav'n help our hope,
                 Help our hope,
                           farewell! <br>

       [LEONARD embraces MERYLL and PHOEBE, and then exits. PHOEBE
       weeping.<br>

  MERYLL    [goes up to PHOEBE] Nay, lass, be of good cheer, we
            may save him yet.<br>

  PHOEBE    Oh! see, after— they bring the poor gentleman from the
            Beauchamp! [pronounced Bee'cham] Oh, father! his hour
            is not yet come?<br>

  MERYLL    No, no— they lead him to the Cold Harbour Tower to
            await his end in solitude. But softly— the Lieutenant
            approaches! He should not see thee weep.<br>

       [Enter FAIRFAX, guarded by YEOMEN. The LIEUTENANT enters,
       meeting him.<br>

  LIEUT.    Halt! Colonel Fairfax, my old friend, we meet but
            sadly.<br>

  FAIRFAX   Sir, I greet you with all good-will; and I thank you
            for the zealous acre with which you have guarded me
            from the pestilent dangers which threaten  human life
            outside. In this happy little community, Death, when
            he comes, doth so in punctual and business-like
            fashion; and, like a courtly gentleman, giveth due
            notice of his advent, that one may not be taken
            unawares.<br>

  LIEUT.    Sir, you bear this bravely, as a brave man should.<br>

  FAIRFAX   Why, sir, it is no light boon to die swiftly and
            surely at a given hour and in a given fashion! Truth
            to tell, I would gladly have my life; but if that may
            not be, I have the next best thing to it, which is
            death. Believe me, sir, my lot is not so much amiss!<br>
