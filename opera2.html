       [Enter JACK POINT, in low spirits, reading from a huge
       volume
       <h6 class="name">POINT</h6>
       <p class="speech POINT">      [reads] "The Merrie Jestes of Hugh Ambrose, No.
            7863.The Poor Wit and the Rich Councillor. A certayne
            poor wit, being an-hungered, did meet a well-fed
            councillor.'Marry, fool,' quothe the councillor,
            'whither away?' 'In truth,' said the poor wag, 'in
            that I have eaten naught these two dayes, I do wither
            away, and that right rapidly!' The Councillor laughed
            hugely, and gave him a sausage." Humph! the councillor
            was easier to please than my new master the
            Lieutenant. I would like to take post under that
            councillor. Ah! 'tis but melancholy mumming when poor
            heart-broken, jilted Jack Point must needs turn to
            Hugh Ambrose for original light humour!</p>

       [Enter WILFRED, also in low spirits.
       <h6 class="name">WILFRED</h6>
       <p class="speech WILFRED">    [sighing] Ah, Master Point! </p>
       <h6 class="name">POINT</h6>
        <p class="speech POINT">      [changing his manner] Ha! friend jailer! Jailer that
            wast— jailer that never shalt be more! Jailer that
            jailed not, or that jailed, if jail he did, so
            unjailery that 'twas but jerry-jailing, or jailing in
            joke— though no joke to him who, by unjailerlike
            jailing, did so jeopardise his jailership. Come, take
            heart, smile, laugh, wink, twinkle, thou tormentor
            that tormentest none— thou racker that rackest not—
            thou pincher out of place— come, take heart, and be
            merry, as I am!— [aside, dolefully]— as I am!</p>
